Randomeness and unpredictability may shape the course of events.

Hi, I'm Andrea.

Driven by curiosity and enthusiasm, I am fascinated by the data lifecycle: from the storage and open-source of data, to building models / algorithms for analysis, to explore inshight from uncertainty across observations, space, time, both.

On this profile, I share R and Python prototypes and projects developed by myself, trying to include data and dependencies for reproducibility.
