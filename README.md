## Ciao ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Andrea. I believe that sometimes randomness plays a role in shaping the world. Driven by curiosity and enthusiasm, I am fascinated by the data lifecycle: from secure storage in databases or on the cloud to building models and algorithms for analysis and interpreting complex effects in multidimensional spaces. 

Here, I share my prototypes and projects made from scratch in Python and R, with all the libraries and source for reproducibility.
